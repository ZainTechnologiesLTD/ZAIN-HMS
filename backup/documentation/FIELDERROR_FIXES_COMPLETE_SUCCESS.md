# üéâ COMPLETE FIELDERROR FIXES SUCCESS REPORT

## üìã Issues Resolved

### 1. **Hospital Selection FieldError** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Original Error**: `FieldError at /auth/hospital-selection/ Cannot resolve keyword 'is_active' into field`

**Root Cause**: Hospital model uses `subscription_status` field, not `is_active`
**Solution**: Updated Hospital queries from `is_active=True` to `subscription_status='ACTIVE'`

### 2. **Appointment Date FieldError** ‚úÖ FIXED  
**Original Error**: `Cannot resolve keyword 'date' into field` for Appointment model
**Root Cause**: Appointment model uses `appointment_date` field, not `date`
**Solution**: Updated Appointment queries from `date=today` to `appointment_date=today`
