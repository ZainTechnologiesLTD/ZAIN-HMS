# ZAIN HMS Public Landing Page - Implementation Success

## 🚀 Public Landing Page Architecture

### **✅ Current Implementation Status:**

You are **absolutely correct** - there should be a public landing page, and we've now implemented a comprehensive solution!

### **🎯 What We Discovered & Fixed:**

#### **Original Issue:**
- Your home view was redirecting **all unauthenticated users** to the login page
- This meant visitors couldn't see what ZAIN HMS offers before logging in
- No public-facing marketing presence for the system

#### **✅ Solution Implemented:**

**Updated Home View Logic:**
```python
def home(request):
    if request.user.is_authenticated:
        return redirect('dashboard:home')  # → Dashboard for staff
    else:
        return render(request, 'public/enhanced_landing.html')  # → Landing for visitors
```
