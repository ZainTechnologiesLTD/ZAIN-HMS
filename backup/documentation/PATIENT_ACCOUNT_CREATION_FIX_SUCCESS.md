## 🎯 Problem Description

### Error Encountered
```
Error creating patient account: no such table: main.accounts_hospital
```

### Root Cause Analysis
The patient account creation had multiple issues:
1. **Incorrect Service Usage**: Patient views were instantiating UserManagementService instead of using static methods
2. **Model Field Mismatches**: Views referenced non-existent Patient model fields (`user`, `address`)
3. **Foreign Key Constraints**: Patient model save operations failed due to cross-database foreign key validation
4. **Database Routing**: Patient models in tenant databases couldn't validate Hospital/User references in default database

### Multi-layered Issues
```
Patient Creation Workflow:
1. Form submission → Patient View
2. UserManagementService.create_user_account() [FIXED: Static method usage]
3. Patient model creation [FIXED: Field mappings]
4. Patient.save() to tenant database [FIXED: Foreign key constraints]
```

## ⚡ Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

#### 1. apps/patients/views.py
**Purpose**: Fix UserManagementService usage and field mappings  
**Changes**: 
- Changed from `UserManagementService()` instance to static method call
- Fixed address field mapping from `patient.address` to proper address fields
- Removed non-existent `patient.user` assignment

```python
# BEFORE (causing errors)
user_service = UserManagementService()
user = user_service.create_user_account(...)
patient.user = user

# AFTER (fixed)
user = UserManagementService.create_user_account(...)
# Note: Patient model doesn't have direct user field
```

#### 2. apps/doctors/views.py & apps/nurses/views.py
**Purpose**: Fix UserManagementService usage consistency  
**Changes**: Updated to use static method calls instead of instantiation

```python
# BEFORE
user_service = UserManagementService()
user = user_service.create_user_account(...)

# AFTER
user = UserManagementService.create_user_account(...)
```

#### 3. apps/patients/models.py
**Purpose**: Handle cross-database foreign key constraints  
**Changes**: Override save() and delete() methods with foreign key constraint management

```python
def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
    """Override save to handle cross-database relationships and generate patient ID"""
    if not self.patient_id:
        self.patient_id = self.generate_patient_id()
    
    using = kwargs.get('using', 'default')
    
    # If saving to a tenant database, temporarily disable foreign key checks
    if using and using != 'default':
        from django.db import connections
        connection = connections[using]
        with connection.cursor() as cursor:
            cursor.execute("PRAGMA foreign_keys=OFF")
            try:
                super().save(*args, **kwargs)
            finally:
                cursor.execute("PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON")
    else:
        super().save(*args, **kwargs)

def delete(self, using=None, keep_parents=False):
    """Override delete to handle cross-database relationships"""
    if using and using != 'default':
        from django.db import connections
        connection = connections[using]
        with connection.cursor() as cursor:
            cursor.execute("PRAGMA foreign_keys=OFF")
            try:
                super().delete(using=using, keep_parents=keep_parents)
            finally:
                cursor.execute("PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON")
    else:
        super().delete(using=using, keep_parents=keep_parents)
```

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

### Test Script Created
- **File**: `test_patient_creation_fix.py`
- **Purpose**: Validate complete patient account creation workflow

### Test Results
```
🔍 Testing Patient Account Creation Fixes...
✅ Using admin user: babo
✅ Using hospital: Downtown Medical Center

🧪 Testing UserManagementService.create_user_account...
✅ Successfully created user via service: test.patientdirect.patient
✅ User ID: cf6568c6-09f9-4e48-bf03-a284a6cb0f54

## 🔧 Technical Details

### UserManagementService Integration
```python
# Correct Usage Pattern
user = UserManagementService.create_user_account(
    email=patient.email,
    first_name=patient.first_name,
    last_name=patient.last_name,
    role='PATIENT',
    hospital=request.user.hospital,
    created_by=request.user,
    additional_data={
        'phone': patient.phone,
        'date_of_birth': patient.date_of_birth,
        'gender': patient.gender,
        'blood_group': patient.blood_group,
        'address': f"{patient.address_line1}, {patient.city}, {patient.state}",
    }
)
```

### Database Architecture Compatibility
```
Multi-Tenant Setup:
├── Default Database (shared)
│   ├── accounts_user (Patient user accounts)
│   ├── accounts_hospital
│   └── accounts_profile
└── Tenant Databases (hospital-specific)
    ├── patients_patient (Patient records) ✅ FIXED
    ├── appointments_appointment
    └── other tenant models
```
