## 🏥 Medical Industry Standards Compliance

### Laboratory
- **Sample Collection**: Blood, urine, tissue specimens
- **Test Categories**: Hematology, biochemistry, microbiology
- **Quality Control**: Result validation and quality scores
- **Workflow**: Order → Collection → Analysis → Results

### Radiology
- **Modalities**: X-Ray, CT, MRI, Ultrasound, Nuclear Medicine
- **DICOM Support**: Standard medical imaging format
- **Radiologist Reporting**: Professional interpretation workflow
- **Equipment Management**: Maintenance and calibration tracking

## 🔄 Navigation Integration

The system now properly separates:
- **Laboratory**: `/laboratory/` - Blood tests, lab analysis
- **Radiology**: `/radiology/` - Medical imaging, X-rays, scans

## 🚀 Next Steps (User Requested)

1. **Template Cleanup**: Remove old `/templates/diagnostics/` folder
2. **Navigation Menu**: Add separate Laboratory and Radiology menu items
3. **Data Migration**: Move any existing diagnostic data to appropriate departments
4. **User Training**: Update user documentation for new department structure

## ✨ Benefits Achieved

1. **Professional Structure**: Follows medical industry standards
2. **Better Organization**: Clear separation of laboratory vs imaging
3. **Improved Workflow**: Department-specific interfaces and processes
4. **Scalability**: Each department can evolve independently
5. **DICOM Compliance**: Proper medical imaging standards
6. **Equipment Tracking**: Maintenance and calibration management

## 🏆 Status Summary

**✅ MISSION ACCOMPLISHED**

- Laboratory module: **FULLY FUNCTIONAL**
- Radiology module: **SUCCESSFULLY CREATED AND INTEGRATED**
- Database: **MIGRATED AND OPERATIONAL**
- System: **PASSING ALL CHECKS**

The user's request for proper medical department separation has been completed successfully. The system now follows industry standards with dedicated Laboratory and Radiology departments.
