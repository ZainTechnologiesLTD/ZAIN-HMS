# ðŸ”§ HospitalFilterMixin Fix - AttributeError Resolved

## Issue Identified
**Error**: `AttributeError: 'DoctorListView' object has no attribute 'filter_by_hospital'`

**Root Cause**: The `HospitalFilterMixin` was missing the `filter_by_hospital()` method that the views were trying to call.

## âœ… Solution Applied

### 1. Enhanced HospitalFilterMixin
**File**: `apps/accounts/permissions.py`

**Added the missing method**:
```python
def filter_by_hospital(self, queryset):
    """
    Filter a queryset by the current user's hospital
    
    Args:
        queryset: Django QuerySet to filter
        
    Returns:
        Filtered QuerySet
    """
    # If user is not authenticated, return empty queryset
    if not self.request.user.is_authenticated:
        return queryset.none()
    
    # If user has no hospital, return empty queryset
    if not self.request.user.hospital:
        return queryset.none()
    
    # Filter by user's hospital
    filter_kwargs = {self.hospital_filter_field: self.request.user.hospital}
    return queryset.filter(**filter_kwargs)
```

### 2. Fixed Hospital Filter Field Names
**Problem**: Different models link to hospital through different field paths:
- Doctor: `user__hospital` (through User relationship)
- Nurse: `user__hospital` (through User relationship)  
- Patient: `hospital` (direct relationship)
- Appointment: `hospital` (direct relationship)

**Solution**: Added `hospital_filter_field` to each view class:

**Doctors Views** (`apps/doctors/views.py`):
```python
class DoctorListView(RoleBasedPermissionMixin, HospitalFilterMixin, ListView):
    hospital_filter_field = 'user__hospital'  # Doctor is linked via user
    
class DoctorDetailView(RoleBasedPermissionMixin, HospitalFilterMixin, DetailView):
    hospital_filter_field = 'user__hospital'  # Doctor is linked via user
    
class DoctorUpdateView(RoleBasedPermissionMixin, HospitalFilterMixin, UpdateView):
    hospital_filter_field = 'user__hospital'  # Doctor is linked via user
    
class DoctorDeleteView(RoleBasedPermissionMixin, HospitalFilterMixin, DeleteView):
    hospital_filter_field = 'user__hospital'  # Doctor is linked via user
```

**Nurses Views** (`apps/nurses/views.py`):
```python
class NurseListView(RoleBasedPermissionMixin, HospitalFilterMixin, ListView):
    hospital_filter_field = 'user__hospital'  # Nurse is linked via user
```

### 3. Fixed Import Conflicts
**Problem**: Nurses app had its own `Department` model conflicting with the main `Department` in accounts app.

**Solution**: Updated imports in `apps/nurses/views.py`:
```python
# Before
from .models import Nurse, Department, NurseSchedule, NurseLeave

# After  
from .models import Nurse, NurseSchedule, NurseLeave
from apps.accounts.models import Department  # Use Department from accounts
```
