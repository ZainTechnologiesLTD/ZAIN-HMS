- Configuration files (.env, requirements.txt)
- Database files (db.sqlite3, hospital databases)
- Main project files (manage.py, zain_hms/)

## Single Hospital Architecture Status

The project has been successfully converted to a single hospital per user architecture:
- Multi-tenant documentation archived
- Single hospital approach implemented
- User 'sazzad' successfully assigned to 'Demo Medical Center'
- Context processors updated for single hospital approach
- Template tags simplified

## Files That Should NOT Be Restored

The following backed up files are obsolete and should not be restored:
- Multi-tenant implementation scripts
- Old enhancement/fix documentation (superseded by current implementation)
- Debugging scripts (used for troubleshooting resolved issues)
- Multiple test scripts (functionality now working)

## Safe to Restore (if needed)

The following could be safely restored if needed:
- requirements files (for reference)
- Some setup scripts (for fresh installations)

## Notes

This cleanup was performed to:
1. Reduce project clutter
2. Focus on active, working code
3. Preserve development history in organized backup
4. Improve project navigation and maintenance

The single hospital approach is now working correctly with user 'sazzad' able to login and access the dashboard at http://127.0.0.1:8002/
